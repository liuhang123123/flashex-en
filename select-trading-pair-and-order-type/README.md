* Choose the contract pair you wish to trade (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT).
* If the desired pair is not visible, tap the **search icon** on the left to locate it.

### **Step 2: Choose an Order Type**

FlashEx offers **three order types** to suit different trading strategies:

1. **Limit Order**
2. **Market Order**

You may select the preferred order type based on your trading objective.

âœ… No matter which mode you choose, FlashEx allows you to **set up both the entry and the take-profit exit in a single operation**.
