# API Configuration

## API Overview

API connects FlashEX to your OKX account. Once configured, FlashEX can assist in executing your trades securely and efficiently.

**Tip:** Existing OKX users can log in and authorize directly. New users must register with OKX first.

## Method 1: Automatic Authorization (Recommended)

1. Open the FlashEX App
2. Tap “OKX OAuth Login”
3. Redirect to the OKX official authorization page
4. Log in to your OKX account
5. Review requested permissions (read-only and trade access), then confirm
6. Upon success, you’ll return to FlashEX and API binding is complete

## Method 2: Manual Configuration

1. Log in to your OKX account
2. Navigate to API Management
3. Click “Create API”
4. Select "Bind to Third-Party App" and search for “FlashEx.Pro”
5. Grant Read + Trade permissions
6. Set a passphrase (you will need this later in FlashEX)
7. Save your API Key, Secret Key (shown only once), and Passphrase
8. Return to FlashEX and enter the three values in the API Settings page
9. Submit to verify and complete authorization
