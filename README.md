## Secure, Transparent, User-Owned Assets

> * **Assets are 100% under user control:** Crypto assets are always held in the user’s own OKX account. FlashEX does not and will not host any user funds.
> * **Trades are 100% user-initiated:** All trading commands are triggered by the user. FlashEX neither matches trades nor interferes with strategies, ensuring dual autonomy over assets and operations.

## Product Philosophy

FlashEX is not just a tool for user-controlled trading—

It is a trading philosophy that changes outcomes—not through luck or speculative bets, but through steady compounding returns.

FlashEX exists not only to enable faster API order execution or price tracking—but to guide users toward a new way of trading:

**— A philosophy centered on win rate, grounded in discipline, and aimed at long-term compounding.**

{% hint style="success" %}


We believe that:

* Every small arbitrage win is a testament to rational strategy.
* Every secured profit is a seed for compound growth.
* Earning a little every day is the start of long-term profitability.

Let stable arbitrage become your daily routine, and long-term returns your confidence.
