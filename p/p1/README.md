# STEP 1: Select Cryptocurrency & Order Mode

## Step 1: Select the Cryptocurrency

In the FlashEX main interface, navigate to the USDT-based perpetual contract list (currently supporting only OKX USDT-based perpetual contract pairs). Select the desired USDT-based contract pair for trading. If the desired pair is not displayed, you can search for it by clicking the search button on the left.

## Step 2: Choose an Order Mode

FlashEX offers three order modes: **Limit Order**, **Market Order**, and **Planned Order**. Users can choose the order mode based on their trading needs.

Regardless of the mode selected, FlashEX allows users to complete both the opening and closing of positions with a single setup.

For a detailed explanation, please refer to "Order Mode Details" :&#x20;
