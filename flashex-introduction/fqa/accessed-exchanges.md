# Exchange Integration

## Exchanges Integrated with FlashEX

FlashEX is currently integrated with the OKX exchange. Both new and existing users of OKX can apply for an API on the official OKX platform, configure it within the FlashEX App, and use FlashEX to perform cryptocurrency arbitrage trading (specifically for USDT-based perpetual contracts).\
\
In the future, FlashEX will gradually support other top-ranked exchanges worldwide.

## Partnership

Top-ranked exchanges around the world are welcome to contact us for collaboration. Email: Cooperate@FlashEX.pro
